  <p>I am Alexander Chan (He, His), and my goal in this GitHub repository is to create a website that looks cool and creative. Simultaneously, I aim to delve into the intricacies of understanding how to become a better front-end and back-end coder. I like to play basketball, listen to music and share my creative projects. </p>
