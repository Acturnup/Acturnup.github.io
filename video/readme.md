My passion was to examine various forms of interactive/narrative audio including sonic art installations, musique concrete, radio storytelling, interactive audio for games, film audio, and more. I was able to will learn how to use new tools in audio production, music composition, arranging, and sound design to produce sound that is most effective in engaging the audience.

In this project, I took some footage of a video game called CS:GO and added in my own audio to sync up with the interactions.
